"""
Embeddings — computed locally via sentence-transformers, not over the
network. The model is pre-downloaded into the Docker image at build
time (see Dockerfile), so there is zero network dependency at runtime.

This replaces the earlier HF Inference API approach, which was prone
to intermittent ConnectTimeout failures — dangerous for a live demo,
since a failed call silently degraded to a near-meaningless hash-based
embedding and tanked confidence scores unpredictably.

Same model as before (multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, tuned for asymmetric
question -> passage retrieval), same 384-dim output — this is a
drop-in replacement, nothing downstream (chroma_client.py,
knowledge_agent.py) needs to change.

FIX (Render free-tier OOM): main.py's ingest endpoint used to call
embed_batch() ONCE with every chunk from the whole document — for a
multi-page circular that's 30-50+ chunks encoded simultaneously,
spiking peak RAM right when a 512MB instance has the least headroom
(model + ChromaDB + FastAPI + the PDF bytes already in memory). This
now encodes in small batches internally instead, so peak memory is
bounded by BATCH_SIZE regardless of how large the document is. This
is the change directly, not a config flag — main.py's call site is
unchanged (still one embed_batch(docs) call); the batching happens
inside this function so nothing else needs to know about it.
